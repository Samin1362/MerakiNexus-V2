# MerakiNexus: V2

## Overview

**MerakiNexus** is an innovative decentralized platform that bridges the gap between artists and hosts using AI-driven artwork evaluation and a tokenized economy. The system evaluates artworks based on aesthetic quality, sentiment, and memorability, providing artists with a tokenized reward system that promotes creativity and equitable access to the art market. Powered by cutting-edge deep learning models and blockchain technology, the platform facilitates transparent and secure transactions.

## Project Components

1. **AI-Driven Art Evaluation:**
   The project utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models, including **ResNet50**, **AlexNet**, **Vision Transformer**, and **EfficientNet**, to evaluate artworks across multiple aesthetic categories. The evaluation process includes assessing the **balance**, **color harmony**, **depth & perspective**, and **texture & brushwork** of artworks, generating a comprehensive **aesthetic score**.

2. **Tokenization & Reward System:**
   Based on the AI-driven evaluation, artists are rewarded with tokens. These tokens can be utilized by hosts to collect artworks, promoting a decentralized, merit-based art marketplace.

3. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Integration:**
   Using blockchain technology, the platform provides a secure and transparent environment for both artists and collectors. The tokenized reward system allows for peer-to-peer exchanges without intermediaries, ensuring a fair and decentralized marketplace.
